This repo holds the code for a static personal website. The subject of the website is something near and dear to my heart: me. 

You might also notice that this repo contains a lot of weird files pertaining to Wordle/Lizle. A while back to impress my then crush now girlfriend, I modified the Wordle source code so she could play the wordle at noon isntead of midnight because she was such a wordle fiend. She still plays it occasionally, so my pages still hosts it.
